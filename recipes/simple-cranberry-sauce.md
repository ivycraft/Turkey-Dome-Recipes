Though it lacks the classic grooves in the stuff from a can, this knocks its socks off.

Cranberry sauce is a great plce to be creative! Maybe you'd like it more with honey or maple syrup in place of the sugar. Maybe you'd enjoy lime instead of lemon. Maybe a splash of vanilla would be interesting! Or try cloves or other whole spices in place of the cinnamon sticks (if the spices are small, tie them up in a cheeseclotch satchel for easy removal).

## Ingredients

- 12 ounces of fresh cranberries
- ½ cup sugar (vary this depending on your taste; I prefer my cranberry sauce more tart and less sweet)
- 1 lemon, orange or citron (Buddha's hand)
- 2 cinnamon sticks (optional)

## Instructions

1. Rinse 12 ounces of cranberries and place with ½ cup of sugar and cinnamon sticks (if using)  in a pot. 

2. Use a zester (I prefer microplane but any will do) and scrape the citrus zest into the cranberries. If you're using a lemon or orange, use the whole fruit. If you're using a citron (Buddha's hand) then zest half of it.
