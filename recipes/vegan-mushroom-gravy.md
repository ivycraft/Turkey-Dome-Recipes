# Vegan Mushroom Gravy

VEGAN * GLUTEN FREE * POSSIBLY KETO

**Servings:** ~40 ¼ cup servings  **Prep time:** 15 minutes  **Cooking time:** 75 minutes

This is a slightly complicated recipe - you'll want to roast the mushrooms first and collect some of the liquid that will run off from them. Then you'll use the liquid and the mushrooms to make the gravy.

This recipe makes a lot of gravy. If you want less, reduce the quantity of mushrooms you roast and then reduce other ingredients to the same fraction. Cooking time will remain the same.

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds of white, cremini (brown) or shitake mushrooms, or a combination thereof
- ¼ cup (mushroom roasting) + ½ cup (starch cooking) of fat (extra-virgin olive oil is a great choice but any light flavored fat should be fine)
- 8 to 12 sprigs of thyme and/or rosemary
- ½ cup of arrowroot starch, cornstarch, potato starch or flour
- 2 quarts vegetable stock
- salt and pepper to taste


## Instructions

1. Roast the mushrooms and collect their liquid by following Serious Eats' [Easy Roasted Mushrooms](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/12/easy-roasted-mushroom-food-lab-recipe.html) _this step is vital to bring out the earthy flavor of the mushrooms - if you skip it you'll end up with bland gravy_

2. Put the fat in a pot big enough to hold the stock plus the mushrooms and their liquid.

3.Make the roux (cooked starch): heat the fat. When it's hot, add the starch (arrowroot or whatever you're using). Whisk the starch into the fat.

4. Slowly add the stock, no more than a cup at a time. Whisk it into the roux to gradually combine them. This is the step that will make or break the gravy. Add the stock too fast and it's likely to be lumpy and uneven. Whisk it in gradually and it should be smooth.

5. When all of the stock has been combined with the roux, add the mushrooms and the reserved mushroom liquid. Stir as you bring the gravy to a boil.

6. Let simmer a few minutes, stirring gently. Remove from heat and add salt and pepper to taste.


## Notes

I tried making this using moistened coconut flour but it didn't thicken the stock and the gravy was thin and grainy.

Arrowroot is much lower carb than cornstarch or flour. Given that most people aren't going to drink a lot of the gravy, it might be suitable for someone following a keto diet.

| starch | carbs/cup | carbs/serving
|------------|----|----|
| arrowroot  | 16g  | 0.2g
| flour      | 95g  | 2.3g
| cornstarch | 117g | 1.5g  _assumes using ¼ cup of starch_
| potato starch | 133g | 1.7g _assumes using ¼ cup of starch_

The carbs/serving column assumes the recipe makes 10 cups of gravy and a serving is ¼ cup.

The rule of thumb when using flour or arrowroot to thicken gravy is 1 tablespoon of fat to 1 tablespoon of starch to 1 cup of stock. 

Both corn and potato starch thicken liquids more easily than regular flour, so try using half the quantity of the starch and fat. If you want the gravy thicker, cook more starch in an equivalent amount of fat in a separate pot; as it thickens, gradually whisk it into the gravy and bring to a boil.
