Delicata squash makes a delicious, nutritious side. You don't even need to peel it!

## Ingredients

- 1 delicata squash
- 1 tablespoon dry sage (more or less depending on your preferences and the size of the squash)
- 1 teaspoon dry thyme (more or less depending on your preferences and the size of the squash)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450°F

2. Take one delicata squash. Rinse the outside of it to remove any dirt or ick. Carefully slice it down the middle lengthwise.

3. Using a finger or spoon, scoop out the seeds. You can clean them, roast them like pumpkin seeds and eat them if you want, or you can plant them, compost them or feed them to your goats.

4. Cut each side of the squash into a half cross-section, maybe ¼" to ⅓" wide. Put them in a bowl.

5. Pour olive oil over the squash slices. Sprinkle on sage, thyme, salt and pepper. Toss to evenly coat the slices.

6. Line a pan with parchment paper - I find the squash sticks to it less than it does to foil, but you can use foil or just a bare pan if you don't mind cleaning it afterwards. Try to use a pan (or multiple pans) so that the squash slices are in a single layer, not piled on one another.

7. Roast for 30 minutes, turning or shaking up the sliced squash after 15 minutes. Turning it will help it cook and caramelize more evenly, but you can skip it if you want to. If the squash doesn't seem quite done yet, give it up to another 15 minutes (with another turn).
