#### Step 1: Danger Everywhere!

Every year deep fryer fires are responsible for the destruction of ~1000 homes in the United States. Be careful!

Along with continually measuring temperature and maintaining 350F (170C) while cooking, Keeping the oil level at least 5 inches (12 cm) below the rim of your deep fryer after your turkey is fully submerged is critically important. If you do not do this, you'll have boil over and potentially set the oil on fire as it drips down the side of the pot and comes into contact with your heat source. 

The easiest way to ensure safe operation of your fryer is by measuring displacement. To do this, place your thawed turkey into your fryer in the orientation it will be while cooking. Fill the fryer with water until you have 1-2 inches (3-5cm) of water covering your turkey. Remove the turkey and measure the water level in the fryer. This is how much oil you'll need to add after the turkey has been brined. We measured by mounting our candy thermometer on the side of the pot in it's lowest position and used that as a gauge.

#### Step 2: Brine

* 6 quarts (6 liters) vegetable stock
* 1 pound (500 grams) salt
* 0.5 pounds (250 grams) brown sugar
* 5 pounds (2.5 kilograms) ice
* 1 x 18 pound (8 kilogram) turkey, thawed, with giblets removed
* 1 tablespoon (15 mililiters) allspice berries
* 1 tablespoon (15 mililiters) black peppercorns
* 1 tablespoon (15 mililiters) candied ginger, diced
* 5 gallon (19 liter) water cooler
* 50 feet (15 meters) butcher's twine

Prep Time: 1 hour

Brine Time: 24 hours

1. combine the stock, salt, brown sugar, allspice, peppercorns and ginger to a large sauce pan. Heat to a simmer, stirring occassionally, then let cool to 130F or less.

2. add the thawed turkey into your 5 gallon water cooler, cavity up.

3. pour the mostly cooled brine into the turkey cavity.

4. add ice, stir then close the water cooler for 24 hours.

5. after 24 hours, drain most of the liquid using the water cooler's lower spigot, then remove the turkey to a large tray or bowl and let drain, patting dry inside and out with paper towels.

6. Truss the bird with butcher's twine. We improvised this part, but the goal is to have the bird's legs and wings close to it's body so it has a chance to cook more evenly.

#### Step 3: Fry that Turkey!

* 40 quart (38 liter) fryer pot
* Approximately 5 gallons (19 liters) peanut, or other high heat oil (see smokepoint table below)
* large gas burner
* propane
* geodesic dome
* butcher's twine
* aluminum vertical turkey frying rack
* geodesic dome or 7 foot (2.2 meter) tall metal ladder
* at least 3 caribiners
* probe or candy thermometer
* backup thermometer (probe, candy or infrared)
* turkey probe thermometer
* 6 more probe thermometers

Prep Time: 1-2 hours

Cook Time: 3.5 minutes per 1 pound (2 minutes per 3 kilogram)

1. There are a few ways to prep the bird for immersion in oil. The best way is to get an 'aluminum vertical turkey frying rack' (you can google this). Because our bird needed to go sideways in order to be fully immersed while safely having enough space at the top for the oil level, we ended up creating a suspension basket using [butcher's twine and an aluminum pizza rack](https://github.com/ivycraft/turkey-dome-recipes/raw/master/images/turkey-rigging.jpg). We also dropped in some stainless steel spacers to rest our rack above the bottom of the container, where the heat can potentially burn the turkey and cause other problems. 

2. Setup your pulley system. Your bird is now mounted on a vertical frying rack or some other improvised creation, the important feature being that you'll be able to suspend it securely from the top. Now it's time to setup the rigging for safely lowering your turkey into the oil. A [2:1 pulley](https://github.com/ivycraft/turkey-dome-recipes/raw/master/images/2to1pulley.jpg "2 to 1 pulley") will give you the simplest and most stable way to lower the turkey into your oil. If you don't yet feel confident that you understand the process that's about to happen, first, carefully read [this document](https://github.com/ivycraft/turkey-dome-recipes/raw/master/images/AB-turkey-derrick.pdf "Alton Brown Turkey Derrick") about setting up your suspension system.

3. Add oil. Remember when we marked the amount of oil we needed by submerging the turkey in the oil pot using water to measure displacement? Fill your fryer with that predetermined amount of oil that will allow for safe turkey frying.

3. Ok, so the bird is prepped, rigging is setup and we're just about ready to go. It's now time to get the oil heated. Light the burner and bring the oil temperature up to 300F (150C). At 300F, slowly and carefully, using your rigging system, lower your turkey into the fryer until completely submerged, then tie off.

4. Increase the fryer temperature to 350F (180C) and maintain until the end of your cook. Use temperature probes in the deepest part of the turkey's breast or thigh to get an accurate reading. You're looking for an internal temperature of at least 160F (70C).

5. Once cook time is complete, remove the turkey from the fryer and carefully transfer to a large heat resistant tray or bowl. Let rest for 30 minutes then carve and serve. Some of our turkey's skin was a bit black. Don't be alarmed! Give it a taste test and if a bit too cooked, remove, but the meat underneath should be just fine if you've followed temperature and time instructions.
